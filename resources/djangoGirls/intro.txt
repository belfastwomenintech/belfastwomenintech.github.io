We want women to experience what it is like to code and work with technology. Our goal is to create a safe environment where women can explore technology.

We are trans-inclusive and welcome all women from all walks of life. Men are welcome to attend as well. We don't want men out of the IT industry, we just want more women in it.

If you are female and between the ages of 18-100 you can apply for a pass! You donâ€™t need to know any technical stuff - it is a very informal day and we will have coaches on hand.
